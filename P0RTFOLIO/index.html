            Super Plumber Bros" is a classic 2D side-scrolling platformer game
            inspired by the popular game "Super Mario". In this game, players
            control a skilled frog character who embarks on an exciting
            adventure. Players must navigate through challenging levels filled
            with obstacles, collect power-ups, and defeat enemies such as
            Goombas, Koopas, and other creatures using the plumber's wrench or
            by jumping on them. The game includes a variety of power-ups, such
            as mushrooms that grant additional health or size, fire flowers that
            allow the plumber to shoot fireballs, and star power-ups that
            provide temporary invincibility.
